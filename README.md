# ðŸ“Š Study Time vs. Score Prediction using Linear Regression

This project explores linear regression for machine learning using Python, focusing on predicting academic scores based on study hours.

## Overview

This predictive model demonstrates the relationship between study time and expected score, answering the question:

> "If I study for X hours, what will my score likely be?"

## Features
- **Linear Regression Model**: Uses linear regression to analyze and predict scores based on the time spent studying.
- **Python Implementation**: Built with Python, leveraging libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation and modeling.
- **Score Forecasting**: Predicts a probable score (Z) when given a specific study duration (X).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/study-score-prediction.git
   cd study-score-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the model to predict scores based on study hours:
```python
# Example usage
hours_feature = 56  # Example: studying for 56 hours
predicted_score = model.predict(np.array([hours_feature]).reshape(-1, 1))
print(f"If you study for {hours_feature} hours, your score will likely be > {predicted_score[0][0]:.2f}")
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib (for optional visualizations)

## Results

The model provides a straightforward way to predict potential academic performance based on dedicated study time, useful for students and educators alike.
